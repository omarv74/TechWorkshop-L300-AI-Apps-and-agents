# Exercise 02: Implement a multimodal AI shopping assistant

## Scenario

This training will have you implement a customer proof of concept using Azure AI Foundry. The customer in this scenario is Zava, a retail chain that specializes in "do-it-yourself" solutions for home improvement projects. Zava would like to build a shopping assistant that helps customers choose the correct products for their own home improvement projects. Customers will be able to upload images and short videos, ask questions regarding the set of products available from Zava, and make purchases, all from a multimodal chat interface.

In this exercise, we will build a series of agents and test them locally before deploying the application code to Azure.

## Objectives

After you complete this exercise, you will be able to:

* Build a chat application that allows customers to research products, add products to a cart, and receive loyalty discounts
* Incorporate multiple AI agents to satisfy specific customer needs
* Deploy applications to Azure from Visual Studio Code

## Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes
