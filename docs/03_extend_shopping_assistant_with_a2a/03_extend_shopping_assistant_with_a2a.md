# Exercise 03 - Extend the shopping assistant using the A2A Protocol

## Scenario

In the previous exercise, you implemented a multimodal AI shopping assistant for Zava using Azure AI Foundry. The assistant allows customers to upload images and short videos, ask questions regarding the set of products available from Zava, and make purchases, all from a multimodal chat interface. However, Zava would like to extend the capabilities of the shopping assistant by integrating it with additional AI services and tools. This will allow the assistant to provide more personalized recommendations, improve the accuracy of product searches, and enhance the overall customer experience.

In this exercise, we will use the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol to enable communication between multiple AI agents. This will allow us to create a more sophisticated shopping assistant that can leverage the strengths of different AI models and services.

## Objectives

After you complete this exercise, you will be able to:

* Understand the A2A Protocol and its benefits
* Implement A2A communication between multiple AI agents

## Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 40 minutes
